# pandas challenge overview

In this project, I used Pandas in Jupyter Notebook to analyse school and student data in hopes of uncovering trends in performance.
The data was loaded from two .csv files and aggregated into a combined DataFrame. It was then analysed further to calculate the following:
- The total number of schools, total number of students, total budget and average maths and reading performance rates on a district level.
- The above metrics then calculated per school.
- A ranking table of all schools based on overall % of students passing maths and reading, showing the highest and lowest performing schools in the district.
- A grade comparison of average math and reading scores and pass rates for grades 9-12 of each school.
- Categorisation of schools by per capita budget and comparison of average math/reading scores and pass rates for each budget category.
- Categorisation of schools by size (total number of students) and a comparison of the same metrics for each size category.
- Finally, a comparison of the above metrics per school type (charter/district).

The skills demonstrated here include: loading .csv data into jupyter notebook, creating and manipulating pandas DataFrames, aggregating data using left outer joins, grouping data using groupby functions, data formatting, and binning and labelling.

# files

All relevant files are located in the 'PyCitySchools' folder.

The .csv files used are located in the 'Resources' folder. 
The school data is contained in the 'schools_complete.csv' file.
The student data is contained in the 'students_complete.csv' file.

The 'Analysis' folder contains the jupyter notebook script and results in the file titled 'PyCitySchools_main.ipynb'.
A report summarising results and conclusions is also located here, titled 'PyCitySchools Summary Report.docx'.
